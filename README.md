### Summary of functionality

This Java application is designed to retrieve meteorological data from the eight Canary Islands and store them in a directory. 
For this purpose, three modules are used: one for data capture (Weather Provider), another for storage (Event Store Builder), and a broker 
that serves as an intermediary, managing the transmission of events between the preceding modules

### Resources used

This program has been developed through a Maven project in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment. Additionally, Git version
control tool and its web repository, GitHub, have been used to ensure the persistence of all modifications made.

ActiveMQ was used as a broker, an open-source message broker that implements the Java Message Service (JMS) API, providing a
reliable and scalable messaging solution. It supports various messaging patterns, including point-to-point and publish/subscribe,
and it enables the exchange of messages between different components in a decoupled manner.

On the following page, you will find the getting started guide and installation documentation for ActiveMQ, https://activemq.apache.org/getting-started
